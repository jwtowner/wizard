# Wizard
#### *Automatic software source package configuration*

#### Overview

Wizard is a standalone application and reusable library that provides a highly-expressive, portable and functional alternative to GNU Autoconf for software source configuration.

Wizard is written in Scheme (R7RS-small) and is known to work on the following Scheme implementations:

- Chibi Scheme
- Chicken Scheme
- Gauche Scheme

#### Planned Features

- First-class support for working with C, C++, and assembly language toolchains and source files.
- First-class support for managing build variants, toolchain configuration settings, and cross-compilation targets.
- High-level solution and project specification language that can generate Ninja build files, Visual Studio solution/project/props files, and Xcode project files.
- Support for `pkg-config` on Unix systems.
- Support for working with the Android NDK.
- Colored text output on both Windows and ANSI TTY compatible terminal shells.
- Prebuilt binaries for Linux, OS X, and Windows.

#### Status

Work in progress.
